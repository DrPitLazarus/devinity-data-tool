# Devinity Data Tool

Provides a REST API and an UI to get data from Devinity's database. 

## API (WIP)

The API provides endpoints that the UI can consume to display data. 
It runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) using the [fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify) web framework.

For more information, look at the `README.md` inside the `api` folder.

## UI (Planned)

The UI provides a web frontend that users can use to browse data from the API.

For more information, look at the `README.md` inside the `ui` folder.
